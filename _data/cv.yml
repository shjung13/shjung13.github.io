  summary: I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the University of Washington, where I am advised by Prof. Byron Boots. I am interested in visual learning for robotics, bridging the gap between visual perception and robot planning/control.
              My recent research covers general robot perceptions problems in robot navigation including vision-language to navigation, traversability prediction from visual cues by self-supervision and representation learning from LiDAR and images.
